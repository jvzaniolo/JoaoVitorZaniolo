"If you can't beat the fear, just do it scared!" - Glennon Doyle Melton

I love technology and it's really nice to be a part of this modern world.
To be able to bring my projects to life and see them working is something amazing.

😋 One of my biggest dreams is to bring others the same joy and fun that I have when programming.

🏣 Today I work as a front-end developer using Angular and Flutter.
💻 But I'm also a huge fan of Node and React, that's why I keep doing online classes and personal projects to enhance my skills. You can check them out on my Github page.

🎒 Right now I'm attending at GoStack Bootcamp from Rocketseat and I'm learning stuff like DDD, TDD, SOLID, backend concepts, database structure, styled-components, hooks, states, and more. 🚀

🥳 I also love to play video games with friends and family, listen to music, and eat burgers!
