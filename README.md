## 🧑🏻‍💻 Work
Today I work as a front-end developer using HTML, SASS, JavaScript, Angular and Flutter.

## 💜 Interest
I'm a huge fan of Node and React, that's why I keep doing online classes and personal projects to enhance my skills.

## 🪐 Goals
One of my biggest dreams is to bring others the same joy and fun that I have when programming.

## 👔 Courses
🚀 Right now I'm attending at GoStack Bootcamp from Rocketseat and I'm learning stuff like DDD, TDD, SOLID, styled-components, hooks, states, redux, Nextjs and more!

## 🎮 Hobbies
I love to play video games with friends and family, listen to music, and eat burgers!
